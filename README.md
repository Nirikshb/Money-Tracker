 I'm currently creating a Money Tracker App.
 What I'm trying to make is 
 An Expense Tracker with two pages using routes which should be accessible after user has loggeed in. I      would be using (https://reqres.in/) as the backend server for login
 
 
 Features would include : 
 1. Add money movement (Income/Expense) with detail.
 
 2. Filter out data based on multiple filters avaiable
 
 3. CRUD operation on Expense Data.
 
 4. User Authentication
 
 
 What i would be using to complete : 
 React Routing, React Templating Library, Redux, 
 
 Vercel Deployment, Login Flow, LocalStorage, 
 
 API call with axios, Error Handling, 
 
 Working with Forms and Hooks
